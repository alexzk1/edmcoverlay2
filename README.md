# edmcoverlay2

[EDMC Overlay][] for Linux.

## Installation

- Clone the repo into your EDMC plugins directory
  - NB: you must name the directory `edmcoverlay`, not `edmcoverlay2`
- Run `make`
- In the EDMC settings, configure the size and position of the overlay

## Usage

edmcoverlay2 aims to be 100% compatible with EDMC Overlay. Both the
Python library and the local server (running on port 5010) are present,
although for new plugins I highly recommend using the Python library
where possible.

Some features are not yet implemented, and there are likely to be bugs.
